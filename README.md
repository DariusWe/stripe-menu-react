Probably the most accurate recreation of stripes animated menu (stripe.com) out there, built with react. Has some minor imperfections that result from mounting/unmounting the menu tabs instead of just pushing them out of the menu container and making them invisible. You can notice these flaws when switching between tabs really fast.

The background animation, which you can also find on stripe's landing page, is not done by me. It's copy/paste code from https://whatamesh.vercel.app/.
