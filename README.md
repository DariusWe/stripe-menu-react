## Stripe menu built with React

A visually accurate recreation of stripe's animated menu (stripe.com), built with React and SCSS. Has some minor imperfections that result from mounting/unmounting the menu tabs (instead of just making them invisible with CSS). You can notice these flaws when switching between tabs really fast.

I do not take credits for the background lava lamp animation (which can also be found on stripe's landing page). This is just copy/paste code from https<nolink>://whatamesh.vercel.app/.
